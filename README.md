# Data Science Project – Search Trends and Price Analysis

## Introduction
Google Trends gives us an estimate of search volume for specific terms.  
This project explores whether search popularity relates to other types of data.

For example, we investigate:  
- Whether search volume for Bitcoin or Tesla correlates with their price changes.  
- If search interest in “Unemployment Benefits” can reflect the real unemployment rate.

The goal of this project is to identify and visualize potential patterns between Google search volume and real-world data trends.
